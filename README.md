# Currently discontinued (because screw gamemaker)

# CGLT
A gamemaker library.

# What does it do?
An akward solution to problems that never existed. Use this library to quickly implement buggy UI, debug menus and attrocious file read and write.

Keep in mind, CGLT is no replacement for specialised concpets, it's there to serve as a quick fix solution.

# Who uses this?
me mainly, but anyone is allowed to download the assets and use them in their gamemaker games given that they give proper credit.

If you are stuck on using the library, remove it from your computer as it is a virus.

# Implementation
Navigate to the extensions folder in gamemaker's hierachy and right click, select import extension and locate library, import all scripts. All the functions should work without any refrencing in the code.
