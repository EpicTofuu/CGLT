# CGLT
A gamemaker library.

# What does it do?
CGLT is a growing open source gamemaker library, it takes all the boring heavy work out of the way leaving you with easy to use methods to put in your games. UI elements and debug menus run straight out of the box. Best of all, I'm encouraging contributions.

# Who uses this?
me mainly, but anyone is allowed to download the assets and use them in their gamemaker games given that they give proper credit.

There are still lots of unfinished scripts and weird bugs that are in the library, if you want something that doesn't suck, d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶m̶a̶k̶e̶r̶, use another library :P

If you are stuck on using the library, take a look at the code or check the wiki in the repo. I'm making an official website for CGLT soon.

# Implementation
Navigate to the extensions folder in gamemaker's hierachy and right click, select import extension and locate library, import all scripts. All the functions should work without any refrencing in the code.

No real documentation has been made yet, you'll just have to look at the code yourself
